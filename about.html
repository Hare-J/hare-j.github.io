                <h3>Niagara College Peer Tutoring</h3>
                <p>
                    During my second and third terms I was hired by the college as a peer tutor for a number of classes
                    and helped over a dozen
                    students to understand difficult concepts in C#, Javascript, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly, to me at least, this was immensely helpful for my own learning as well, as it forced
                    me to
                    research simpler topics that
                    might have been skimmed over otherwise. Additionally, it gave me extra practice programming simple
                    apps
                    through creating example
                    and practice work for the students I tutored to help give more context to the content they were
                    learning
                    in class.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom:15px">Community Project</h3>
                <p>
                    During my fourth term with the college I helped work on a custom point-of-sales system for a
                    local food charity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project I was part of a team of six students with the goal of designing and developing this
                    system from the ground up, working with the client from the beginning to deliver the features they
                    wanted to streamline different day-to-day tasks for their business. We ended up creating this system
                    as
                    a web app using C# and SQLite with the Model-View-Controller design pattern and spent four months
                    total
                    working on it.

            <!-- MISSION STATEMENT -->
            <div class="row">
                <h2>My Mission Statement</h2>
                <i>Every piece of work you create represents you as a person and should be completed to the highest
                    possible
                    (and realistic) standard.</i>
                <p>
                    While it can often be tempting to take the easy way through things, I have found that doing so
                    rarely
                    leads me to a place of positive growth.
                </p>
                <i>A team is only as strong as its ability to support its weakest members.</i>
                <p>
                    In the past there have been many situations where
                    I have been the one offering support, but also many where I felt completely alone and lost, and
                    these
                    have been my absolute
                    worst experiences both for project outcome and growth. For the good of everyone, and for the good of
                    the
                    project, it is
                    always the right thing in my experience to support your team above all else.
                </p>
                <i>Failure is an important contributor to growth and should be treated as a valuable learning
                    experience.</i>
                <p>
                    Some of the most
                    important and lasting experiences during my development as a professional and as a person have been
                    failures. Obviously
                    it's better to avoid failure when at all possible, but that isn't always an option and if you're
                    going
                    to fail you might
                    as well accept the discomfort and take away as much as you possibly can from it.
