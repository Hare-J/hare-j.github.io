                    My name is James and I am a full-stack programmer in Welland, Ontario. I graduated from Niagara
                    Collegeâ€™s Computer Programmer Analyst advanced diploma program in December 2022, maintaining Honours
                    Status in four of the five semesters completed while peer tutoring on the side as often as I could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a wide variety of experience across many areas of software development, as both an individual
                    and a team member,
                    building everything from SQLS data warehouses to complex point-of-sale systems.
                    Some of the projects I'm most proud of, or even just had the most fun working on, can be found
                    in the

            <h3>Niagara College Peer Tutoring</h3>
            <p>
                During the Fall of 2021 I was hired by Niagara College as a peer tutor for some of the courses I had
                taken in the Computer Programmer Analyst program. I mainly focused on helping new students get the hang
                of early web development, data structures, and RAD using ASP.NET C# by going over in-class examples,
                assignments, and creating more focused code snippets on the fly to better demonstrate more tricky
                concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a lot of fun helping my peers better understand the more difficult course content, especially from
                the first couple semesters of the program where some of them had little to no prior experience
                programming. I was in the same boat coming into the program and without amazing teachers I might not
                have fallen in love with the field like I did, and I wanted to spread that love as best as I could.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom:15px">Community Project</h3>
            <p>
                During the Spring of 2022, I took part in a community project along with five other classmates that I
                had worked with previously.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective of this project, with some guidance from our teachers, was to work with a local business
                to create a point-of-sale system to better suit their needs. We met with the business owners regularly
                to establish project requirements and provided them with numerous prototypes as development progressed,
                building out their web app piece by piece from the database to the UX and everything in between.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was built as an ASP.NET Core Web App in C# and used a SQLite database.

                            In my sixth semester I took a course on mobile development with Java, which
                            included a
                            hands-on test that required me
                            to create a TCP/IP client-server chatroom. This was pretty different from what I'd done to
                            that point, which was almost exclusively done in
                            C# and was more focused on developing stand-alone apps that would at most communicate with a
                            database or API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite some early difficulties, I ended up having a lot of fun with this
                            project and even went as far as to include a "command" functionality for writing private
                            messages to specific users, displaying a list of currently connected users, and displaying a
                            list of commands.

                    worked mainly with
                    MVC views and razor code in C#, but this seemed like a great opportunity to get some more
                    experience creating
                    responsive, modern web pages.

                    and Xamarin Forms (MAUI.NET) apps
                    in C# using both MVC and MVVM design patterns. For my final project in this course, I decided to
                    build
                    an API and
                    accompanying Xamarin Forms app.
                    The Xamarin Forms app is still in development, but the API is functional with Swagger.

                    At the beginning of my fourth term with Niagara College, I was put into a team of six that I had
                    previously worked with
                    in another course with the intention of taking on a long-term live development process for a local
                    charity competing with three other
                    groups for app adoption.

                <p>
                    Throughout the four month long term, we designed the application from the ground up, meeting with
                    the
                    client regularly to
                    make sure we were including everything they wanted and were able to plan for future feature
                    implementations. This made for a great lesson in the importance of
                    teamwork and
                    communication on large projects, especially given the tight deadlines we had to work with. We built
                    the
                    application using the C# MVC framework for all the inner workings and front
                    end, and SQLite
