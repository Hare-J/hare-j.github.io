                <p>
                    My name is James and I am a full-stack software developer in Welland and graduate of
                    Niagara College's Computer Programmer Analyst program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a wide variety of experience in all areas of software development, as both an individual
                    and a team member,
                    building everything from SQLS data warehouses to complex point-of-sale systems.
                    Some of the projects I'm most proud of, or even just had the most fun working on, can be found
                    in the

                </p>
                <p>
                    I am extremely passionate about building quality software following solid object-oriented design
                    for
                    ease of future use
                    and development.

            <h3>Niagara College Peer Tutoring</h3>
            <p>
                During my second and third terms I was hired by the college as a peer tutor for a number of classes
                and helped over a dozen
                students to understand difficult concepts in C#, Javascript, and T-SQL development.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was immensely helpful for my own learning as well, as it forced
                me to
                research simpler topics that
                might have been skimmed over otherwise. Additionally, it gave me extra practice programming simple
                apps
                through creating example
                and practice work for the students I tutored to help give more context to the content they were
                learning
                in class.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom:15px">Community Project</h3>
            <p>
                During my fourth term with the college I helped work on a custom point-of-sales system for a
                local food charity.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project I was part of a team of six students with the goal of designing and developing this
                system from the ground up, working with the client from the beginning to deliver the features they
                wanted to streamline different day-to-day tasks for their business. We ended up creating this system
                as
                a web app using C# and SQLite with the Model-View-Controller design pattern and spent four months
                total
                working on it.

                <p>
                    In my sixth semester one of the courses I took was on mobile development with Java, which included a
                    hands-on test that required me
                    to create a TCP/IP client-server chatroom. This was pretty different from what I'd done to that
                    point,
                    which
                    was almost exclusively done in
                    C# and was more focused on developing stand-alone apps that would at most communicate with a
                    database. It was also my first time doing
                    any work with multithreading, which was difficult at first but enjoyable to work through.

                and CSS with
                Bootstrap. I didn't have much experience with web development specifically before this project, having
                worked mainly with
                MVC views and razor code in C#, but this project seemed like a great opportunity to get some more
                experience creating
                responsive, modern web pages.

                During my fourth term I took a course in mobile development where I learned how to build custom API's
                and Xamarin Forms (MAUI.NET) apps
                in C# using both MVC and MVVM design patterns. For my final project in this course, I decided to build
                an API and
                accompanying Xamarin Forms app.
                The Xamarin Forms app is still in development, but the API is functional with Swagger.

            <p>
                At the beginning of my fourth term with Niagara College, I was put into a team of six that I had
                previously worked with
                in another course with the intention of taking on a long-term live development process for a local
                charity competing with three other
                groups for app adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the four month long term, we designed the application from the ground up, meeting with the
                client regularly to
                make sure we were including everything they wanted and were able to plan for future feature
                implementations. This made for a great lesson in the importance of
                teamwork and
                communication on large projects, especially given the tight deadlines we had to work with. We built the
                application using the C# MVC framework for all the inner workings and front
                end, and SQLite
                for their database.
