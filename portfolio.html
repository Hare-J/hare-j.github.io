                <p>
                    In my sixth semester one of the courses I took was on mobile development with Java, which included a
                    hands-on test that required me
                    to create a TCP/IP client-server chatroom. This was pretty different from what I'd done to that
                    point,
                    which
                    was almost exclusively done in
                    C# and was more focused on developing stand-alone apps that would at most communicate with a
                    database. It was also my first time doing
                    any work with multithreading, which was difficult at first but enjoyable to work through.

                I made this entire site from scratch for COMM1310 in my final semester with Niagara College with HTML
                and CSS with
                Bootstrap. I didn't have much experience with web development specifically before this project, having
                worked mainly with
                MVC views and razor code in C#, but this project seemed like a great opportunity to get some more
                experience creating
                responsive, modern web pages.

                During my fourth term I took a course in mobile development where I learned how to build custom API's
                and Xamarin Forms (MAUI.NET) apps
                in C# using both MVC and MVVM design patterns. For my final project in this course, I decided to build
                an API and
                accompanying Xamarin Forms app.
                The Xamarin Forms app is still in development, but the API is functional with Swagger.

            <p>
                At the beginning of my fourth term with Niagara College, I was put into a team of six that I had
                previously worked with
                in another course with the intention of taking on a long-term live development process for a local
                charity competing with three other
                groups for app adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the four month long term, we designed the application from the ground up, meeting with the
                client regularly to
                make sure we were including everything they wanted and were able to plan for future feature
                implementations. This made for a great lesson in the importance of
                teamwork and
                communication on large projects, especially given the tight deadlines we had to work with. We built the
                application using the C# MVC framework for all the inner workings and front
                end, and SQLite
                for their database.
